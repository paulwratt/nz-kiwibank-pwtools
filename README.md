Auto-Refresh Accounts after login, while you are waiting for your account transactions to update

(now also accessible from my [pwtools collection](https://github.com/paulwratt/pwtools) repo)

## usage
 - **userscripts** require a GreaseMonkey compatible engine, like TamperMonkey, ViolentMonkey, etc
 - this userscript is designed for the HTML webpage, _not_ the web/phone app

 - [Kiwibank webpage login](https://ib.kiwibank.co.nz/) - KiwiBank (NZ) internet banking homepage
   - [Auto-Refresh Accounts](https://github.com/paulwratt/nz-kiwibank-pwtools/blob/main/kiwibank.user.js) after login, while you are waiting for your account transactions to update, randomly auto-click _Resfresh_ per minute (adjustable) - ([install&nbsp;.user.js&nbsp;v1.0.3](https://github.com/paulwratt/nz-kiwibank-pwtools/raw/main/kiwibank.user.js))
